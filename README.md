# PGP Encryption & Decryption Tool

## Overview
The PGP Encryption & Decryption Tool is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application that provides a user interface for encrypting and decrypting text using RSA cryptography. This tool demonstrates the use of a 2048-bit RSA key for secure cryptographic operations, suitable for learning and small-scale secure communication tasks.

## Features
- **RSA Encryption/Decryption**: Leverages RSA cryptography to securely encrypt and decrypt messages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily encrypt or decrypt messages.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Immediate feedback on encryption and decryption operations directly within the GUI.

## Getting Started
